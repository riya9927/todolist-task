# Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration

## Overview

This project is designed for aspiring ReactJS Developers to demonstrate their skills in frontend development, React, and API integration. The application involves building an advanced To-Do application with features such as task management, state handling using Redux, and user authentication.

## Demo Login Credentials

To access the application, use the following credentials:
- **Email:** `user@example.com`
- **Password:** `password`

## Features

1. **Frontend Development and API Integration**
   - Structure the application's layout using **HTML**.
   - Style the application using **CSS** (optional: frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI).
   - Integrate a public API (e.g., Weather API) to display dynamic, relevant data.
   - Implement error handling for API requests to display user-friendly error messages.

2. **React Components and Advanced State Management**
   - Create functional components and use React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
   - Components:
     - **TaskInput:** For adding new tasks.
     - **TaskList:** For displaying the task list.
   - Implement state management using **Redux** with middleware like **Redux Thunk** or **Redux Saga** for handling asynchronous API calls.

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the application is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   - Use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for a responsive layout.
   - Follow a mobile-first design approach.

4. **Functionality**
   - **Add Task:** Input tasks via a text field and add them to the list.
   - **View Tasks:** Display all tasks in a user-friendly list.
   - **Delete Task:** Remove a task from the list using a delete button.
   - **Task Prioritization:** Allow users to set and display task priorities (High, Medium, Low).
   - **Persistent Storage:** Store tasks and authentication status using local storage or session storage.

5. **User Authentication**
   - Add simple login/logout functionality using **Redux** for state management.
   - Mock authentication for login (no backend integration required).
   - Protect the To-Do list so that tasks are only visible to logged-in users.
